## ⚙️ How to Run Locally

Follow these simple steps to set up the project on your machine:

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-resume-builder-analyzer.git
    cd ai-resume-builder-analyzer
    ```

2.  **Setup the Backend**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```
    > **Important:** Configure any required API keys (like for the Gemini API) within the backend's configuration files or environment variables before starting. Refer to backend documentation/code for specifics.
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The backend server will start, typically at `http://localhost:5000`.

3.  **Setup the Frontend**
    *(Adapt these steps based on your specific frontend framework)*

    *If using plain HTML/CSS/JS, you might just open the `index.html` file.*

    *If using React/Next.js:*
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    npm install
    npm run dev  # Or your specific start command (e.g., npm start)
    ```
    The frontend development server will start, typically at `http://localhost:3000`.

4.  **Access the Application**
